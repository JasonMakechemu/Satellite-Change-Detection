# Satellite-Change-Detection

In this repository, I keep code that I developed for STAR.VISION Aerospace.

This code implements machine learnng change detection algorithms to detect chanegs in urbanisation in Southern Africa, particulary South Africa (the country).

In short - this code takes in two satellite images, a before and after, and outputs a predicted mask showing the change from one image to the next.

A more detailed explanation follows below, as well as instructions on how to run this code.
